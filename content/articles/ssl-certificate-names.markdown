## Common Name


## Subject Alternate Names (SAN)


## Single-name SSL certificate


## Wildcard SSL certificate


## Root domain


## Which one should I use?

Just as a reminder, the _common name_ is required for any certificate, it determines the product type and therefore also the cost of the product that will be charged on your card. The _SAN names_ are only available in certain SSL certificates.
